This repository represents my continuous journey of learning and practicing JavaScript. It contains a wide range of examples, exercises, and small projects that I have built to strengthen my understanding of programming fundamentals. Each file or project demonstrates a different JavaScript concept â€” from the basics like variables, loops, and functions, to more advanced topics such as event handling, DOM manipulation, ES6 features, and working with arrays and objects.

In addition to learning concepts, I created small projects such as a daily quote generator and other mini applications that combine JavaScript logic with HTML and CSS styling. These projects not only helped me apply what I learned in a practical way but also improved my ability to debug, structure code, and enhance user experience with design elements.

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress and build a strong foundation in JavaScript by writing code regularly, experimenting with new ideas, and refining my problem-solving skills. It also acts as a reference for future projects, allowing me to revisit and improve earlier code as my knowledge grows.

I am continuously updating this repository as I explore new concepts and build more mini-projects. My goal is to evolve this collection into a personal JavaScript playground that reflects both my learning process and my ability to transform ideas into functional applications.
